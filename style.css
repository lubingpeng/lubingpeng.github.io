This task should help you check what you remember from the course.

In this task you just have to recreate what you see in the picture.
Some rules:
1. You can (and should) modify the HTML file, but 
   you are only allowed to add on div tag and some classes. 
2. The whole thing is 960px wide. That's how it has to be ;)
3. All the spacing has to stay the same
4. It obviously has to be in the center on any size of the screen
